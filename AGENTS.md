# Contributor Guidelines

## Setup

After cloning, run:

```sh
./setup.sh
```

This installs all project dependencies. The environment loses network access after setup, so installing packages manually will fail.

## Common Tasks

- **Lint**: `npm run lint`
- **Build**: `npm run build`
- **Tests**: run `npm test` (or `npm run test`) if a test script is defined in `package.json`.

## Commit Messages

Use clear, descriptive commit messages that explain the purpose of your changes.
